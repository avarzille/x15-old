 * Lockless synchronization.
 *
 * The llsync module provides services similar to RCU (Read-Copy Update).
 * As such, it can be thought of as an efficient reader-writer lock
 * replacement. It is efficient because read-side critical sections
 * don't use expensive synchronization mechanisms such as locks or atomic
 * instructions. Lockless synchronization is therefore best used for
 * read-mostly objects. Updating still requires conventional lock-based
 * synchronization.
 *
 * The basic idea is that read-side critical sections are assumed to hold
 * read-side references, and objects for which there may be read-side
 * references must exist as long as such references may be held. The llsync
 * module tracks special system events to determine when read-side references
 * can no longer exist.
 *
 * Since read-side critical sections can run concurrently with updates,
 * it is important to make sure that objects are consistent when being
 * accessed. This is achieved with a publish/subscribe mechanism that relies
 * on the natural atomicity of machine word updates in memory, i.e. all
 * supported architectures must guarantee that, when updating a word, and
 * in turn a pointer, other processors reading that word obtain a valid
 * value, that is either the previous or the next value of the word, but not
 * a mixed-up value. The llsync module provides the llsync_store_ptr() and
 * llsync_load_ptr() wrappers that take care of low level details such as
 * compiler and memory barriers, so that objects are completely built and
 * consistent when published and accessed.
 *
 * As objects are published through pointers, multiple versions can exist at
 * the same time. Previous versions cannot be deleted as long as read-side
 * references may exist. Operations that must wait for all read-side references
 * to be dropped can be either synchronous, i.e. block until it is safe to
 * proceed, or be deferred, in which case they are queued and later handed to
 * the work module. As a result, special care must be taken if using lockless
 * synchronization in the work module itself.
 *
 * The two system events tracked by the llsync module are context switches
 * and a periodic event, normally the periodic timer interrupt that drives
 * the scheduler. Context switches are used as checkpoint triggers. A
 * checkpoint is a point in execution at which no read-side reference can
 * exist, i.e. the processor isn't running any read-side critical section.
 * Since context switches can be very frequent, a checkpoint is local to
 * the processor and lightweight. The periodic event is used to commit
 * checkpoints globally so that other processors are aware of the progress
 * of one another. As the system allows situations in which two periodic
 * events can occur without a single context switch, the periodic event is
 * also used as a checkpoint trigger. When all checkpoints have been
 * committed, a global checkpoint occurs. The occurrence of global checkpoints
 * allows the llsync module to determine when it is safe to process deferred
 * work or unblock update sides.
