 * Generic sleep queues.
 *
 * Sleep queues are used to build sleeping synchronization primitives
 * such as mutexes and condition variables.
 *
 * Although the sleep queues are mostly generic, this implementation
 * relies on knowing whether a synchronization object is a condition
 * variable or not, because waiting on a condition variable unlocks
 * the associated mutex, at which point two sleep queues are locked.
 * Handling condition variable sleep queues slightly differently
 * allows preventing deadlocks while keeping overall complexity low.
 *
 * In addition, despite being used to implement condition variables,
 * this implementation doesn't provide a broadcast call. The rationale
 * is to force users to implement "chained waking" in order to avoid
 * the thundering herd effect.
