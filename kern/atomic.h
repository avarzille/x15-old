 * Supported memory orders.
 *
 * Note that the consume order is aliased to relaxed. This assumes that
 * all supported processors respect data dependencies. The rationale is
 * that the definition for the consume order is confusing enough that
 * most compilers alias it to acquire, which forces the generation of
 * memory barrier instructions even when they're not really needed.
 * Since there is currently no processor where using consume or relaxed
 * would produce different code, it is safe to establish that alias.
 * It serves as explicit documentation for code review, and will easily
 * be replaced with the true consume order once compiler support becomes
 * efficient and reliable.
