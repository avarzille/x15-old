/*
 * Real-time mutex flags.
 *
 * The "contended" flag indicates that threads are waiting for the mutex
 * to be unlocked. It forces threads trying to lock the mutex as well as
 * the owner to take the slow path.
 *
 * The "force-wait" flag prevents "stealing" a mutex. When a contended
 * mutex is unlocked, a thread may concurrently try to lock it. Without
 * this flag, it may succeed, and in doing so, it would prevent a
 * potentially higher priority thread from locking the mutex. The flag
 * forces all threads to not only take the slow path, but to also call
 * the turnstile wait function so that only the highest priority thread
 * may lock the mutex.
