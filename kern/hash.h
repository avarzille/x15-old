 * Hash functions for integers and strings.
 *
 * Integer hashing follows Thomas Wang's paper about his 32/64-bits mix
 * functions :
 * - https://gist.github.com/badboy/6267743
 *
 * String hashing uses a variant of the djb2 algorithm with k=31, as in
 * the implementation of the hashCode() method of the Java String class :
 * - http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/collections/hash_function_technical.shtml
 *
 * Note that this algorithm isn't suitable to obtain usable 64-bits hashes
 * and is expected to only serve as an array index producer.
 *
 * These functions all have a bits parameter that indicates the number of
 * relevant bits the caller is interested in. When returning a hash, its
 * value must be truncated so that it can fit in the requested bit size.
 * It can be used by the implementation to select high or low bits, depending
 * on their relative randomness. To get complete, unmasked hashes, use the
 * HASH_ALLBITS macro.
