 * Per-CPU variables.
 *
 * This module supports statically allocated per-CPU variables only. Each
 * active processor gets its own block of pages, called percpu area, where
 * percpu variables are stored. The offset of a percpu variable is fixed
 * and added to the base of the percpu area to obtain the real address of
 * the variable.
 *
 * A statically allocated percpu variable should be defined with the
 * __percpu macro, e.g. :
 *
 * struct s var __percpu;
 *
 * Obviously, the variable cannot be directly accessed. Instead, percpu
 * variables can be accessed with the following accessors :
 *  - percpu_ptr()
 *  - percpu_var()
 *
 * The cpu module is expected to provide the following accessors to access
 * percpu variables from the local processor :
 *  - cpu_local_ptr()
 *  - cpu_local_var()
 *
 * These accessors may generate optimized code.
 *
 * Architecture-specific code must enforce that the percpu section starts
 * at 0, thereby making the addresses of percpu variables offsets into the
 * percpu area. It must also make sure the _percpu and _percpu_end symbols
 * have valid virtual addresses, included between _init (but not part of
 * the init section) and _end.
 *
 * Unless otherwise specified, accessing a percpu variable is not
 * interrupt-safe.
