/*
 * On i386, the compiler generates either an FP-stack read/write, or an SSE2
 * store/load to implement these 64-bit atomic operations. Since that's not
 * feasible in the kernel, fall back to cmpxchg8b. Note that, in this case,
 * loading becomes a potentially mutating operation, but it's not expected
 * to be a problem since atomic operations are normally not used on read-only
 * memory. Also note that this assumes the processor is at least an i586.
